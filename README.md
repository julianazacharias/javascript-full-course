# Javascript full course

This is a Javascript course that covers the main topics on JS.

This course is from a [Youtube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLZPZq0r_RZOO1zkgO4bIdfuLpizCeHYKv)

## Prerequisites

You can simply run it in your browser, but I recommend running it with Node.js, so you need to have Node.js installed on your system.
